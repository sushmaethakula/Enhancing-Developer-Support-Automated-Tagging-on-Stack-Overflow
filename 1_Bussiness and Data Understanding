Stack Overflow is one of the largest Q&A platforms for programmers, where users post questions on various programming topics.
To facilitate better searchability and categorization, each question is assigned relevant tags that describe its content (e.g., `python`, `machine-learning`, `web-development`).

However, many users may struggle to assign the most appropriate tags, leading to misclassification or difficulty in retrieving relevant content.

**This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically predict the relevant tags for a given Stack Overflow question based on its title and description.**
This will enhance user experience, improve content organization, and reduce the need for manual intervention in tag assignment.

The goal of this project is to **automate the tag assignment process** for Stack Overflow questions by developing a machine learning model that can predict the most relevant tag(s) based on the questionâ€™s title and body (description).

This addresses the following business needs:

- **Improved Searchability**: Accurate tags make it easier for users to find relevant questions and answers.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Reduces the burden on users to manually assign correct tags.
- **Content Organization**: Helps maintain a well-structured, searchable, and consistent knowledge base.
